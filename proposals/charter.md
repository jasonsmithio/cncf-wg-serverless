title: CNCF Serverless Working Group Charter
url: 'proposals/'
---

## Introduction
The Serverless Working Group, is a small group formed by passionate serverless practitioners who are looking to expand the serverless landscape and provide guidance in how it interacts with the larger cloud native landscape.

## Background

While Kubernetes adoption is undeniably on the rise, many plaftorm engineers are experiencing friction in adoption with their developers. Kubernetes is a great platform but isn't the right level of abstraction for developers. This group will provide practices to improve infrastructure abstraction from developers to improve Kubernetes adoption. 

## Goals

This workgroup's objectives are as follows:

- Provide clarity for ourselves and consumers w.r.t. what this topic is all about:
  - Define common terminology
  - Define the scope of the space as it exists today - over time this may change
  - Identify common use cases and patterns between existing implementations
  - Identify where serverless fits in relative to PaaS and container orchestration
- Identify potential next steps for the community (may or may not happen within CNCF):
  - Identifying areas where weâ€™d like to see some harmonization or interop work
- Create a white/position-paper on Serverless in relation to Cloud Native.



## Goal

The Serverless WG aims to aid platform engineers in building the right abstractions on Kubernetes for developers.

## Projects

### [CloudEvents](https://cloudevents.io/)
A specification for describing event data in a common way

### [Serverless Workflow](https://serverlessworkflow.io/)
Standards-based DSL and open-source dev tools and runtimes are at the heart of the Serverless Workflow project. We connect developers around the world to foster innovation and provide a community-driven workflow ecosystem.



This document will serve as the charter for the CNCF Serverless WG in preparation for transition into a TAG. This is derived from this [source doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1L9n9tkGuGtj7Ap9dVRes9RVscSoXeKsF3k-d2hJcDlg/edit).
